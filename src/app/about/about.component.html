    <p>I dunno. Must be a king. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. He hasn't got shit all over him. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
    <p>Bring her forward! <strong> Well, I got better.</strong> <em> Well, how'd you become king, then?</em> A newt?</p>
    <h2>Oh, ow!</h2>
    <p>And the hat. She's a witch! How do you know she is a witch? Camelot! What do you mean? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

      <li>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</li><li>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</li><li>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</li>

    <h3>Where'd you get the coconuts?</h3>
    <p>The nose? Shut up! A newt? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A newt?</li><li>Well, I didn't vote for you.</li><li>Who's that then?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bring her forward! Shut up! Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!</p>
    <p>Bring her forward! Well, how'd you become king, then? A newt? It's only a model.</p>
    <p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Where'd you get the coconuts?</p>
    <p>Be quiet! How do you know she is a witch? I am your king. You don't vote for kings.</p>
    <p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. A newt? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. But you are dressed as oneâ€¦</p>
    <p>Did you dress her up like this? Well, I didn't vote for you. Camelot! Burn her anyway! How do you know she is a witch? How do you know she is a witch?</p>
    <p>What do you mean? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Oh, ow! I'm not a witch.</p>
    <p>The nose? Burn her! Oh, ow! A newt?</p>
    <p>How do you know she is a witch? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
    <p>Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! And the hat. She's a witch! It's only a model. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
    <p>Now, look here, my good man. I have to push the pram a lot. I'm not a witch. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
